"Syria war: US warns of 'more' after missile strikes The US envoy to the UN has warned America may take further action after bombarding a Syrian air base suspected of using chemical weapons. Nikki Haley said her country would not stand by when chemical weapons were used, as it was in its ""vital interest"" to stop their proliferation. Syrian ally Russia accused the US of encouraging ""terrorists"" with its unilateral actions. Moscow has promised to strengthen its ally Syria's anti-aircraft defences.  It is also closing down a hotline with the US designed to avoid collisions between their air forces over Syria. At least six people are reported to have been killed in the US missile strikes early on Friday. US officials say the base was used to launch a chemical weapons attack that killed dozens of civilians on Tuesday. According to Idlib's opposition-run health authority, 89 people, including 33 children and 18 women, died in the suspected nerve agent attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun. Syria denies using nerve gas. Ms Haley told an emergency session of the UN Security Council that America had acted to ensure Syrian President Bashar al-Assad would never use chemical weapons again. ""We are prepared to do more but we hope that will not be necessary,"" she said. ""It is in our vital national security interest to prevent the spread and use of chemical weapons."" She blamed Iran and Russia for standing by the Syrian government when it committed crimes. ""Strengthening Assad will only lead to more murders,"" she said.  Russia's deputy ambassador to the UN, Vladimir Safronkov, described the US strikes as ""illegitimate"". ""When you take your own path, this leads to horrible tragedies in the region,"" he told the Americans. UK ambassador Matthew Rycroft said the strikes were a ""proportionate response to unspeakable acts"". Cruise missiles fly low and have a relatively small radar cross-section so they are difficult to destroy with air defences. Russia may seek to improve Syria's surface-to-air missile system in the wake of this US attack but it would be very much a case of shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted.  Syria used to have a highly effective national air defence system based on Soviet-era radars and missiles but it has been significantly weakened in the wake of the civil war and the loss of territory by the regime. Look at the ease with which the Israelis carry out strikes against Hezbollah arms convoys and weapons stores in Syria.  Russia has some of its most modern surface-to-air missile systems at its air base in Syria and radars with a huge reach but, for whatever reason, they too have not deterred Israeli strikes.  Their presence makes air strikes by manned US aircraft unlikely and for Washington the Tomahawk cruise missile will remain the weapon of choice Two US Navy destroyers in the Mediterranean Sea fired 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at Shayrat airfield in western Homs province at about 04:40 Syrian time (01:40 GMT). They targeted aircraft, aircraft shelters, storage areas, ammunition supply bunkers and air defence systems at the Syrian government-controlled facility, according to the Pentagon. It said the base was used to store chemical weapons and that ""every precaution"" had been taken to avoid casualties. The Russian military was informed beforehand, the Pentagon said. Unnamed US intelligence sources have told media they believe Russian personnel were at Shayrat when Sarin, a nerve agent, was loaded on to a Syrian jet but they have not established whether the Russians knew it was happening. Retired civil servant Mateea Zefa, who lives near the base, went with his children to look at the base afterwards and found it ""totally destroyed"". ""We saw lots of bombs,"" he told the BBC by phone. ""Loads of them. It was a tough night. My house was damaged, almost all the windows broke and some walls cracked."" Houses on one side of the base were also ""totally destroyed"", he added. Some children and other people were injured by shards of breaking glass but no civilians were killed, another witness, Ammar al-Khedr, said. The dead and seriously injured were all soldiers, he said, adding that they had been brought to her hospital. The Syrian army said earlier there had been significant damage to the base.  However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based opposition news service, said  on Friday evening the base was already back in operation and aircraft had taken off and ""struck targets near Palmyra"". The report could not be independently verified. The US has led a coalition carrying out air strikes against jihadist groups in Syria since 2014 but this is the first time it has targeted government forces. President Trump previously spoke out against US military involvement in Syria, instead calling for a greater focus on domestic interests.  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson signalled a sudden shift in policy on Thursday, saying that Bashar al-Assad should have no role in a future Syria. Russia says it has formally notified the Pentagon that as of 21:00 GMT on Friday their air force hotline for Syrian airspace will close down. It also sent a frigate armed with cruise missiles, the Admiral Grigorovich, from the Black Sea to the Eastern Mediterranean on Friday, in what may be a routine move.

"Stockholm lorry rams crowds, killing 'at least four people' A lorry has smashed into a store in central Stockholm, killing at least four people.  At least a dozen people were also injured in the incident on Drottninggatan (Queen Street), one of the city's major pedestrian streets, on Friday afternoon. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said it was a terror attack. One man has been arrested, after police released a CCTV image of a person who may be connected to the case.  Eyewitnesses describe lorry 'trying to hit people' In a speech on Friday night, Mr Lofven said Swedish values of democracy and freedom would not be ""undermined by hatred"". He also announced the country's border controls had been strengthened. The crash happened at the Ahlens department store just before 15:00 local time (13:00 GMT). Witnesses say the lorry drove into the front window.  One eyewitness, Annevi Petersson, told the BBC she was in the shop's fitting room when she heard the screams. ""There was blood everywhere,"" she said. Swedish brewery Spendrups said its lorry had been stolen on its way to a restaurant delivery earlier in the day.  ""Someone jumped into the driver's cabin and drove off with the vehicle while the driver was unloading,"" a brewery spokesperson told the TT news agency.  The shop sits close to the city's central station, which was evacuated.  The metro, central roads and various bus lines were also shut down after the attack.  Shots were reportedly fired in another part of the city, but Swedish police told local media there was no connection between the two incidents.  City authorities said they had made several spaces, including a number of school buildings, available as temporary accommodation for those who could not get home because of transport disruptions.    They have also asked people not to share photographs of the victims online.  I was in Stockholm yesterday, ironically at a security conference. I don't think Sweden was prepared for something like this.  The last big terror incident they had was in 2010 when a failed suicide bomber blew himself up in a car in central Stockholm.  The country has good intelligence-gathering apparatus: Sapo, the Swedish equivalent to the UK's MI5 agency, have got the finger on the problem, but the legislation is not there to deal with it.  Insiders have been concerned for quite some time that Sweden has been a bit lax about security. It is important at this stage, though, to keep an open mind about the perpetrator. It's not impossible that it was someone with personal, psychological problems, rather than a political motive.

"DR Congo: Bruno Tshibala appointed new prime minister Democratic Republic of Congo President Joseph Kabila has appointed Bruno Tshibala as the new prime minister of the power-sharing government.  Mr Tshibala will be leader until presidential elections later this year.  He was expelled from Congo's largest opposition party, the UDPS, last month after contesting the designation of successors to veteran leader Etienne Tshisekedi who died in February.  Mr Tshibala's appointment is likely to further divide Mr Kabila's opponents. Talks to negotiate his exit from power broke down last week. Mr Kabila was supposed to step down after his second and final five-year term came to an end last year but the vote to replace him was not held. The electoral commission cited financial and logistical difficulties.  The arrogance of power The failure to organise the polls led to a wave of deadly demonstrations by opposition supporters, with calls from diplomats for the president to respect the constitution.  The Roman Catholic Church stepped in to broker a deal at the end of 2016 which outlined the creation of a transitional government that would oversee the elections.  But the deal collapsed because the government and the opposition were unable to agree on the power-sharing mechanism under the arrangement.  The country of 71 million people has not had a peaceful transfer of power since its independence from Belgium in 1960.",The appointment is likely further divide opponents of longstanding President Joseph Kabila.

"Trump to make China visit after hosting Xi for talks US President Donald Trump has accepted his counterpart Xi Jinping's invitation to make a visit to China, said Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. Mr Trump is hosting the Chinese president for a two-day visit at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida.  Last year Mr Trump said China had ""raped the US"" and vowed to brand the superpower a currency manipulator. But the meeting appeared to be diplomatic, with both leaders agreeing to a new format for US-China talks.  Mr Tillerson said President Trump's trip to China would be a ""state visit"" in 2017, but gave no other details. ""Both the atmosphere and the chemistry between the two leaders was positive... all of us are feeling very good about the results of this summit,"" said Mr Tillerson. An A-Z of hot topics for Trump and Xi What can Trump do about trade with China? The cost of Trump's 'Winter White House'  The leaders of the world's two most powerful economies agreed to a 100-day plan to discuss trade talks directed at boosting US exports and reducing Washington's trade deficit with China, according to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross.  ""Given the range of issues and the magnitude, that may be ambitious, but it's a very big sea change in the pace of discussion,"" Mr Ross told reporters.  ""I think that's a very important symbolisation of the growing rapport between the two countries."" Mr Trump said he believes he made ""tremendous progress"" in the US-China relationship during talks with Mr Xi. On the night of the Chinese president's arrival, a US airstrike on an airbase in Syria was launched in response to a suspected chemical weapons attack. The attack was made public on Thursday evening just moments after Mr Xi and his wife left the resort following dinner. Beijing has avoided publicly taking sides on the issue. China's position on Syria is much closer to Russia's than to the US.  And the Chinese government will guess that the timing of the American missile strike was a blunt message that without more robust Chinese help on dismantling Kim Jong-un's nuclear programme, the next target for pre-emptive American military action might be North Korea. In Chinese protocol, sudden moves disrupting setpiece occasions are avoided wherever possible, and in private, President Xi is likely to be angry that President Trump chose to strike on the very night of his visit.  But in public Mr Xi stuck to his script about the virtues of co-operation while Mr Trump insisted they'd formed an outstanding relationship and made great progress.  As the two presidents went into their final lunch there were no specifics though, and in the aftermath of the US missile strike on Syria, all the big questions which bedevil the US China relationship have been kicked down the road for President Trump's visit to China later this year. According to a statement on China's foreign ministry website, Mr Xi told Mr Trump: ""We have a thousand reasons to get China-US relations right, and not one reason to spoil the China-US relationship."" The pair discussed a range of issues, including North Korea, which the US believes is trying to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of hitting the west coast of the US. Mr Tillerson said on Friday the US may take its own measure in dealing with Pyongyang.  ""We would be happy to work with them,"" he said. ""But we understand it creates unique problems for them and challenges and that we would and are prepared to chart our own course if this is something China is just unable to co-ordinate with us.""
